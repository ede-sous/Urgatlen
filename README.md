# Urgatlen

 Little personal project in C with SDL 2.0 where you can write the SDL graphic window.
 The goal of this project was to be able to write on the SDL graphic window and then add my own alphabet.
 I know some people want to be able to write on the SDL graphic window so I tried and made it and now anyone can look at it
 to have an idea how to do it.
 
 There are 2 fonts :
 
 ` Urgatlen.tff `           => My own alphabet;
 
 ` AmericanTypewriter.ttc ` => Default font I found;
 
 You can change USING_FONT in includes/urgatlenCONST.h so you can try the 2 differents fonts.
