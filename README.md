# Urgatlen

 Little personal project in C with SDL 2.0 where you can write the SDL graphic window.
 The goal of this was to be able to write on the SDL graphic window and then add my own alphabet.
 
 
 There are 2 fonts :
 
 ` Urgatlen.tff ` => My own alphabet;
 ` AmericanTypewriter.ttc ` => Default font I found;
 
 You can change USING_FONT in includes/urgatlenCONST.h so you can try the 2 differents fonts.
